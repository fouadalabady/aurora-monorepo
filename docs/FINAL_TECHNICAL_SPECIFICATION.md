## 6. Current Status & Next Steps

### âœ… Completed
- Monorepo structure with Turborepo
- Core packages (ui, core, config, analytics, search)
- Database package with Prisma schema
- Search package with MeiliSearch integration (mocked)
- Import alias policy and ESLint enforcement
- Build system working for all packages

### ðŸ”„ In Progress
- Application development (web, cms, api)
- Database integration
- Authentication system

### ðŸ“‹ Next Immediate Tasks
1. Create CMS application structure
2. Create Web application structure
3. Create API application structure
4. Implement authentication with NextAuth.js
5. Connect database to applications
6. Implement basic CRUD operations

### ðŸš¨ Critical Issues to Address
1. Apps directories are currently empty - need to create actual applications
2. Database package needs real Prisma integration (currently mocked)
3. Search package needs real MeiliSearch integration (currently mocked)
4. Authentication system needs implementation
5. API endpoints need development

---

## 7. Technical Debt & Improvements

### Current Technical Debt
1. **Mock Implementations**: Search and database packages have mock implementations that need to be replaced with real functionality
2. **Missing Applications**: The apps directory structure exists but applications haven't been created
3. **Incomplete Integration**: Packages are built but not integrated with actual applications

### Planned Improvements
1. **Real Database Integration**: Replace mock Prisma calls with actual database operations
2. **MeiliSearch Integration**: Replace mock search with real MeiliSearch functionality
3. **Application Development**: Create functional CMS, Web, and API applications
4. **Authentication System**: Implement NextAuth.js across all applications
5. **Testing Suite**: Add comprehensive testing for all packages and applications
